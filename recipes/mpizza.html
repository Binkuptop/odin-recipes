    <h1>Mallawch Pizza</h1>
    <p>I would make thi s meal countless times as a child intil adulthood in my toaster oven but as i grew up and moved out we had to tweak the recepie a bunh. mainly caused by the lack of a toaster oven.</p>
<h3>Ingredents</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mallawach - expensive ones are better</li>
    <li>ketchup</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
    <li>garlic or chili flakes for special spice</li>
</ul>
<p>thi sis a very straightfarwd recipe. make a puzza, into the oven on hottst and enjoy. if missing a toaster oven then you will need to coock the mallawch first, oly then will you be able to add the rest of the pizza making stuff. rather keep the heat from the bottom as to make sure it really does get cooked.
    bake for abou 10-30min.
